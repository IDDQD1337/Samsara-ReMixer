# Samsara ReMixer
### An addon for Samsara Reincarnation
Samsara ReMixer is an addon for Samsara Reincarnation, a gameplay mod for GZDoom and Zandronum. In order to use ReMixer, you will need to load it with Samsara Reincarnation; it will not work with the original version of Samsara or any other forks of the mod.

Samsara ReMixer adds in the enemies from the games represented by its parent mod, allowing for a whole new experience in singleplayer and PVE multiplayer. In addition, there are new settings that modify the monsters and their behaviors, and the player can choose how the monsters are spawned, or even if they should spawn or not. ReMixer is compatible with anything that can be played with Samsara Reincarnation, with different IWADs having specialized support if needed.

## Features
- Monsters from nearly every character's game
- Different settings to modify monster health, speed, and attack behavior
- A monster multiplier and generator that adds more monsters if enabled

## Custom addons coming soon!
ReMixer has been built with user-made monster sets in mind, and although there isn't 100% support for it yet, the framework for it is nearly complete. There will be a custom monster set in the future that allows other users to reference and design their own monster sets.
