// These are special base actors for Remixer monsters, miscellaneous characters,
// and other actors that require them for one reason or another. Because
// of how certain monsters need to be inherited to use their special functions,
// these bases are pretty much copied from the generic monster bases with changes
// needed to get them running. Note that if the generic monster bases are updated,
// then the special bases will also have to be updated.

// Some of these monster bases can be used for ReMixer enemies, provided that they
// don't bring any potential conflicts with them

// Nothing, for now
